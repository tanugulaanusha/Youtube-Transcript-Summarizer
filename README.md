This project is a Chrome extension that automatically summarizes YouTube video transcripts and translates the summaries into different languages. It provides users with a quick overview of a videoâ€™s content without needing to watch the entire video.

Key Features
Automatic Transcript Summarization: Uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract key points from the YouTube video transcript.
Multi-Language Translation: Integrates with the Google Translation API to translate the generated summaries into different languages based on user preference.
Dynamic Summarization: Automatically generates concise summaries when the user clicks on the extension while watching a YouTube video.
User-Friendly Interface: The extension provides an easy-to-use interface, allowing users to quickly view or copy the summary and choose the translation language.

Project Workflow

Transcript Retrieval:
The extension utilizes the YouTube Transcript API to extract the transcript from the video.
If a video contains multiple language subtitles, the user can select the language from which to generate the summary.

NLP-Based Summarization:
The transcript text is processed using Natural Language Processing algorithms to identify the key points, filtering out non-essential details.
Summarization techniques focus on reducing the transcript size while maintaining the core content of the video.

Translation:
After summarizing the transcript, the user can choose a language for translation.
The Google Translation API is integrated to convert the summary into the selected language.

User Interface:
The Chrome extension provides a clean and minimalistic UI.
Users can generate the summary with a single click and view it within the extension.
The UI also allows users to select a translation language from a dropdown menu and instantly view the translated summary.
Technologies Used
HTML, CSS, JavaScript: For creating the Chrome extension and frontend user interface.
Flask: Used as the backend framework to handle API requests and data processing.
YouTube Transcript API: For fetching video transcripts.
Google Translation API: For translating the generated summaries into different languages.
Natural Language Processing (NLP): To process and summarize the transcripts.
